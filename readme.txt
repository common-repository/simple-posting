Send planned Post(ing) to a maximum of 5 Zapier Webhooks. Free Zapier account needed in order to use this plugin.
  
== Description ==
  
Use your Website as a free and simple social media tool for a maximum of 5 Zapier Webhooks.
Each hook can represent a different social media channel (or possibly any connection Zapier offers).

Save time and money as you don´t need any paid third party software to start with if you don´t want to.

Just like for standard posts you got a separate section in the WordPress admin for Simple Postings including categories and tags. 
The only difference is that you can select an Alt-Tag and the social media channels (Zapier webhooks) where you want it to be sent.

Like scheduling a standard post you can schedule your Posting for a specific date. 
As soon as you hit the Planning-Button the Posting gets sent to every activated webhook which schedules your data in Buffer for example.

Every Posting consists of a title, a text, a featured image and an Alt-Tag for this image. No videos possible.

Tipp: After scheduling a Posting you can replan it for another date and reuse it.
